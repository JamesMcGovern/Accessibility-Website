			<h4>What is Accessibility?</h4>
			</header>
				<p> 
				Accessibility, at its core, is a way to assist those with disabilities to use, understand and contribute to a website just as easy as anyone else would. However, accessibility now extends beyond that to the much broader term of allowing anyone to access the web as a basic human right. Accessibility provides use for so many different people on the web and is extremely important in today’s online society.
                <br/><br/>
                The following are some of the disabilities that accessibility aims to aid:
                </p>
                <br/>
                <table style="width:100%">
                  <tr>
                    <th>Disability Type</th>
                    <th>How it effects the user</th>
                    <th>Accessibility to Consider</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Auditory</strong></td>
                    <td>Those that struggle with hearing or cannot hear at all.</td>
                    <td>Can be assisted by avoiding audio clips or producing a log of the speech given in the audio clip/using Closed Captioning for videos.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Cognitive</strong></td>
                    <td>This is a much wider topic but at its core effects people by making them struggle with attention, reading/writing and general learning disabilities. (However, this can also span to more moderate or severe disabilities such as Down's Syndrome).</td>
                    <td>Keeping the site easy to navigate and to the point with its content would be crucial here. Avoiding difficult wording or jargon is also very important.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Neurological</strong></td>
                    <td>This type of disability is often found in the brain but effects the spine and all nerves in between. Some examples of a neurological disability would be epilepsy, Parkinson’s or dementia.</td>
                    <td>Similar to cognitive, it is important to keep content easy to understand and navigate.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Physical</strong></td>
                    <td>This would be those that either struggle to or cannot physically move parts of their body.</td>
                    <td>Users must be able to navigate the site using a keyboard as mouse movements may be impossible for someone with a physical disability. Keeping the tags for the site well structure will also assist any applications the users could be using to help them navigate and use the web.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Speech</strong></td>
                    <td>Those who struggle to or cannot speak.</td>
                    <td>Many sites won’t use speech as in input, but if needed the site must still allow for a text input or text-to-speech availability.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Visual</strong></td>
                    <td>Those who struggle to or are unable to see. This can also include a huge array of different colour-blind variants.</td>
                    <td>Helping those with a visual disability includes having a well-structured site to assist a screen reader. It is also very important to consider web-safe colours for those with colour blindness.</td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                <br/><br/>
                Implementing accessibility can also generally help anyone use the web, not just those with a disability. For example, users could be accessing the site using another device that isn’t a computer. This would mean the site needs to be capable of adapting to the devices screen size. Including media content such as audio or video should include a write up of the content or text alternatives as some users may be unable to listen to that content in certain places or situations. Considering things like house styles and well-structured content is also just nice to look at and will make the site that much easier to spend time on and use, and this is something that will help all visitors to the site! <cite>(Lawton Henry, S.)</cite>
                    <br/><br/>
                    To dive a bit deeper into why accessibility is so important, many of our day to day lives and different important processes, such as Health care and social connections, are online. Considering this, if anyone that had a disability tried to access something from one of these important areas and either wasn’t able to or was limited, this would cause all sorts of issues. The whole idea is to provide equal opportunity, and this can only be possible when accessibility is considered. <cite>(Tobi Emmanuel, O.)</cite>
                    <br/><br/>
                    Accessibility also goes hand in hand with an implementation called <strong>Usability</strong>, this is in a similar field and aims to make web content easy to use and understand. This ranges from navigation to the structure of the text content. Essentially, if the user needs to be told how to use the site, usability hasn’t been considered thoroughly enough.
                    </p>
            
            <h4>Legal, Ethics and Impact of Accessibility</h4>
            <p>
                In 2010 there was a law passed that ensured web equality, this was named the Equality Act 2010. To round it into its most basic form, this law says that all web content must not discriminate with who can access it, essentially to allow equal opportunity. 
                <br/><br/>
                Another huge consideration here is the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), this is an organization that set the standards for web implementation, which includes Accessibility. Making sure that your site follows these standards allows for effective site growth and general user satisfaction. Their key statement for Accessibility is <cite>“The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability.”</cite> … <cite>“it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.”</cite> <cite>(Lawton Henry & McGee)</cite>
                <br/><br/>
                Not fully implementing accessibility can be harmful to a sites progression even when not considering the legal aspects. Search Engine Optimisation, or SEO for short, is something that any good site wants to include. What this does is pushes your site towards the top of the results within web browsers. There are many features that are included with SEO, but accessibility is a massive one as if your site doesn’t include good accessibility then you risk lowering your site massively in the search results. Simply doing something like making sure all images have some alt text or structuring the HTML correctly (correct head and body placements) can have a massive impact on the overall ranking of the site.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Methods of Accessibility</h4>
                <p>
                    There are many ways that accessibility can be implemented to a site, a few important ways are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alt text</strong>: This stands for alternative text. This is most often used to simply describe some media on a site without use of complex language. The reason for this is because the alt text is read out, with the use of a screen reader, for those that are unable to see the resource themselves thus need a way to identify what it consists of.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web safe Colours</strong>: One very important accessibility feature that is often forgotten is the colour scheme of the site. Many users could have a form of colour blindness, with this in mind the colours chosen must either be universally identifiable colours, or the site must have the option to change the colour scheme where necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structuring Tags Correctly</strong>: HTML tags are there for a reason and must be used in the structure that they were intended. Keeping headings as headings. Nesting the correct paragraph tags inside the current div/section tags to keep things organised is very important. Doing this makes the site a lot easier to follow and understand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: One key point here is access through mouse and keyboard. If the site cannot be navigated through mouse and keyboard, this is a massive breach of accessibility as many users will have to rely on a single type of functionality that may not be native to them or could be something, they cannot use in the first place. Good site structure also helps with this as it allows keyboard users to easily navigate through the site without use of a mouse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assisting Screen Readers</strong>: Screen readers are very important to visually impaired users as it helps them understand what is being presented on the screen. Making sure that you use the correct syntax and well worded descriptions for everything is key. One important addition that is greatly overlooked is the caption tag for tables. This allows a screen reader to find the title of a table with ease without just a simple visual indication of what the table is all about.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>
                        In terms of how accessibility can aid a webmaster, starting off with how it effects web users, keeping a site up to standard with these implementations will provide an ease of access to the site for the many, and not the few. Accessibility is something that started out as an ethical issue to allow access to all, regardless of ability which meant that adding it would greatly improve a user’s visit to a site by making it a lot easier with no struggles.<br/><br/>
                        Accessibility has now grown beyond ethics and it is very crucial to understand the legal standpoints and Search Engine Optimisation benefits for a webmaster. Legally, all sites must be accessible to all, meaning that neglecting this could lead to significant consequences for the webmaster and as a standard should never be overlooked. Furthermore, from more of a progression standpoint for a site’s popularity, SEO plays a massive part in gaining traction and traffic. If a webmaster wants their site to be popular, making the site accessible allows it to be picked up upon by the search engine. If the search engine decides that the site meets the standard, it will be pushed towards the earlier results given to a user after a web search, meaning more traffic for the site. Avoiding accessibility means sending your site further to the back of the results.<br/><br/>
                        As a final note, it is clear to see the benefits of adding accessibility to a site. Opting to ignore this implementation can massively impact the webmaster’s site growth and could potentially lead to further legal action if necessary, meanwhile including some simple additions of accessibility can be a massive advantage for any site.
