				For me the process of producing a site based on web accessibility was a very interesting one. From learning about different disabilities to discovering how these disabilities are met and overcome within a web format is truly amazing. When first drafting the site, I had to make sure that the site itself would work to meet the topics I was discussing myself, as there was no point in giving advice about accessibility to just go and completely ignore it myself. The structure of the site itself had to be easy to follow with simple navigation, I opted for the use of side navigation bar with a large menu button to keep from confusion. I then moulded this into 4 main pages, each with relevant content which is well broken up. From here I wanted to ensure that the navigation function well with a keyboard, this is something I have tested a lot. Based on these implementations, I think the actual build of the site went very well. I chose a colour scheme that fit in well with colour blindness and a navigation system that is easy to use. I believe I have accommodated for accessibility very well here.
				<br/><br/>
                    When producing content for the site I partook in a lot of research based around disabilities. This was an enlightening experience for me and definitely allowed me to look at web development from a different perspective. Furthermore, this research has allowed me to grow massively in my web development as I get to consider many aspects of an implementation before they are added which definitely enhances my integrity. Although I mainly saw benefits from this part of the assignment, there were some hardships faced as there are many different forms of disability that I hadn’t considered for web use. From this, not only did I have to understand the point of view from these different disabilities, but I also struggled in actually discussing these disabilities within the content of the site as they are fairly rough topics to explore.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On the other hand, even though I did face these difficulties, I believe that I got a lot more out of this assignment than anticipated. I now get to consider multiple different implementation strategies to both help my sites thrive on the web and to enhance user engagement. Also, learning about accessibility in general was very fulfilling to me. Prior to producing this product, my extent of knowledge around accessibility was limited to alt text, but from this research I have learned about the many different types of accessibility in place to help a wide range of different people.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The actual choice of Accessibility as my chosen topic was an interesting one to me. I have always been intrigued by different strategies in place to improve a sites accessibility. On top of this, a webmaster could greatly benefit from these strategies as they are of massive importance to the online world these days and are crucial for a site to thrive.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If I had to change any part of the process, I would like to look into using some of the mentioned accessibility features and software products as this would not only allow me to understand how to better implement a website but will allow me to learn more about the disabilities themselves. In terms of the actual web implementations, I would have added more interactive features to help get across the message in a way that differed from a block of text. Such as clickable widgets that changed the information given or videos that explained or demonstrated an accessibility feature.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Overall, I feel like my chosen topic along with my implementation were executed well and described each aspect in a clear, concise way. The site itself is appealing with a fair colour scheme and a navigation system that is simple. The content is informative and accurate, which is crucially important for this topic and because of this has allowed me to learn a lot about accessibility.
